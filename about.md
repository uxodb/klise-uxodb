I am an IT engineer and enthousiast always eager to learn more, and eager to apply what I've learned in practice.
In this blog you will be joining me and my technical journey as I will be documenting my projects which will also serve for my own reference.

This blog is running on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> which is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It is free and <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> and allows us to create awesome blogs like this one.

Thank you for joining me, and hopefully you'll enjoy the blog.
