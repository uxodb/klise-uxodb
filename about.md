I am an IT engineer and enthousiast always eager to learn more, and eager to apply what I've learned in practice.
This blog invites you to join me on my technical journey, as I will be documenting my projects, creating a resource for myself (and maybe others) in the process.

This blog is running on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> which is a user-friendly, blog-focused, static site generator. Jekyll is both free and <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a>, allowing us to create awesome blogs like the one you're currently exploring.

Thank you for joining me, and I hope you find the blog enjoyable.
